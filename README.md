# 🕸️ Web Scraping Project (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Web Scraper Extension)

This project is a comprehensive showcase of different web scraping techniques using:

- 🐍 **Requests + BeautifulSoup** — for fast scraping of static websites  
- 🧪 **Selenium WebDriver** — for scraping dynamic, JavaScript-rendered content  
- 🌐 **Web Scraper Browser Extension** — a no-code/low-code scraping solution for structured data

## 🧪 Method 1: Scraping with `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`

This method is best for **static websites** where data is loaded in the initial HTML (i.e., no JavaScript rendering required).

### 🔧 Requirements

Install the following packages before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
🔍 Example Code Flow
python
Copy
Edit
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://example.com/products'
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Select product titles using a CSS selector
titles = [tag.text.strip() for tag in soup.select('div.product-title')]

# Example print
print(titles)
✅ Key Advantages
Simple, fast, and lightweight

Works great for websites without JavaScript-generated content

Easy to use with Pandas to save data to CSV

⚠️ Limitations
Won't work for pages that load content dynamically with JavaScript

Less flexible compared to Selenium for complex interactions

✅ Recommended for news sites, blogs, or any HTML-rendered data.

🧪 Method 2: Scraping with Selenium
Used for scraping dynamic websites that require interaction (clicks, scrolling, etc.).

🔧 Requirements
Google Chrome + ChromeDriver

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install selenium pandas
🚀 Example Code Flow
python
Copy
Edit
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.flipkart.com")

search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
search_box.send_keys("tripod")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)

# Collect product details using find_elements...
titles = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "s1Q9rs")
for title in titles:
    print(title.text)
✅ Key Features
Simulates user interaction (clicks, scrolls, form fills)

Great for JavaScript-heavy sites like Flipkart or Amazon

⚠️ Limitations
Slower than static scraping

Requires ChromeDriver setup

Can be blocked by bot detection

🌐 Method 3: Web Scraper Browser Extension
This is a visual, no-code scraping tool ideal for beginners or non-programmers.

🧩 Installation
Chrome: Web Scraper Extension

Firefox: Available on the Firefox Add-ons store

🪜 Steps to Use
Open the target website (e.g., Flipkart)

Click the Web Scraper icon → Open Sitemap Editor

Create a new sitemap and define selectors

Start scraping and export the data in CSV/JSON

Good for scraping paginated lists and structured websites.

✅ Key Features
No coding required

Works in the browser

Great for structured product listings

⚠️ Limitations
Limited to what the browser can load

Can be slower or blocked for large-scale scraping
